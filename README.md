<b>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</b>

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple 3x3 grid where two players can take turns to place their symbols (X or O). The game automatically announces a winner when one player manages to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In the case of all cells being filled without a winner, a tie message is displayed. The game includes a reset button to start a new game, and a festive confetti effect is shown whenever a player wins.

To play the game, you can clone the repository from GitHub and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The design is enhanced with gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and interactive elements to make the game visually appealing and engaging.

Technologies used in this project include HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactivity. The confetti effect is dynamically created using JavaScript to enhance the celebration of a win.
